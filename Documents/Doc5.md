We use an icon instead of a logo for simplicity and clarity. The inclusion of detailed logos could distract users; however, a logo is still displayed in some specific places, such as on Android apps and as the favicon in the online editor.

### There is only icon of editor not name? what's the problem?

The user interface is versatile and suitable for both mobile and desktop use. On mobile devices, only the editor icon is displayed to maintain screen clarity and avoid cluttering the view. The full "Beyoneer" text is visible when using the desktop mode in a browser.
