### Terms of service 

By using Beyoneer v1.11, whether through the Web Editor, the Marketplace, or the Android APK, you agree to the following terms set by MagmaMinesTeam.

1. Editor Usage (Offline)
Beyoneer is a local-first development tool. Users are granted a non-exclusive license to use the Redirection Engine for coding and previewing projects.

Projects are stored locally on your device hardware.
Android APK:

The mobile application is strictly for workspace management and offline coding. It does not natively include the Marketplace features.
Users may not reverse-engineer the Redirection Logic for redistribution.

2. Marketplace & Submissions
The Marketplace is a community-driven platform. Interaction with this service constitutes an online agreement.

Content Ownership:

When you submit a project via Email or Discord, you grant MagmaMinesTeam the right to host and distribute that project to other users.
Asset Safety:

Submitted code must be free of malicious scripts or "phone-home" trackers.
Download Access:

"Unlocking" a template grants a temporary 24-hour access token. This is not a permanent license; clearing browser data will reset this token.
"MagmaMinesTeam serves as a host for Marketplace content. We are not responsible for the specific logic contained within user-submitted templates."

3. Data & Storage Policy
Because Beyoneer values privacy, we do not provide cloud backups.

Loss of Data:

You are responsible for exporting your projects as ZIP files. MagmaMinesTeam cannot recover data lost due to app uninstallation or browser cache clearing.
4. Monetization

To maintain free access, we utilize third-party redirection and ad links in the Marketplace. Users acknowledge that these external links are necessary for the sustainability of the project.
