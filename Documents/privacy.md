Beyoneer v1.11 (developed by MagmaMinesTeam) operates on a dual-logic system. While we provide online community features, the core development experience remains strictly local and private.

1. The Offline IDE Core
The primary Editor and the Beyoneer Android APK Workspace are designed to function as offline-first environments. Your source code, logic, and project assets are never uploaded to our servers.

Local Redirection: The "Redirection Engine" works entirely on your device's hardware.
No Cloud Sync: We do not offer cloud storage for code to ensure 100% project isolation.
Android Sandbox: The APK version operates within its own local storage, separate from the internet unless you choose to use external CDNs.
2. Marketplace & Online Services
Unlike the Editor, the Beyoneer Marketplace is an online service. When you interact with the marketplace, the following apply:

Temporary Connection: Connection is only required to browse, download, or submit projects.
Unlock Tokens: When you unlock templates, a timestamp is stored in your localStorage to grant 24-hour access. No personal identity is tied to this token.
Public Submissions: Projects you submit via Discord or Email become public property of the marketplace once approved.
 Support & Sustainability
To keep Beyoneer free, the Marketplace uses external links and non-intrusive ad networks. These third parties may collect anonymized data (like IP addresses) for security and ad-delivery, but they have zero access to your private offline workspace.

3. Data Collection Policy
We do not collect personal data, period. We do not require account creation to use the IDE or the Marketplace. Your anonymity as a developer is preserved.

4. Responsibility
As an offline-first tool, you are responsible for your own backups. Clearing your browser data or uninstalling the APK will permanently delete your local projects. We recommend using the **Export ZIP** feature frequently.
